# Anomaly_Detection_In_ECG_Data_Using_An_Autoencoder
Autoencoder-based anomaly detection is a popular technique used in various domains, including the detection of anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) data. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and anomaly detection. In the context of ECG data.
