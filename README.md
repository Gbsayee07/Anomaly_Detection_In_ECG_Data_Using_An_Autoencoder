# Anomaly_Detection_In_ECG_Data_Using_An_Autoencoder

Autoencoder-based anomaly detection is a popular technique used in various domains, including the detection of anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) data. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and anomaly detection. 

In the context of ECG data, it can be used to detect abnormal heart rhythms or other cardiac anomalies.

The code begins by loading ECG data from a CSV file and preprocessing it, ensuring that it's properly normalized and converted into TensorFlow tensors. 

The data is then split into training and testing sets. An autoencoder model is defined, consisting of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input ECG data into a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original data. 

The model is compiled with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function and trained using the normal ECG data. Visualization functions are provided to illustrate the quality of the data reconstruction.

A key aspect of the code is the threshold-based anomaly detection. After training, a threshold is determined using the mean and standard deviation of the MAE loss on the training data. This threshold is used to classify test data as normal or abnormal based on their reconstruction error. The code demonstrates this by classifying and visualizing normal and abnormal ECG data.

This approach is advantageous for unsupervised anomaly detection, as it doesn't rely on labeled anomaly data and can be applied to various applications beyond ECG data, offering flexibility and adaptability. 

However, its effectiveness depends on the quality of the training data and the choice of hyperparameters, which may require fine-tuning for optimal performance.
